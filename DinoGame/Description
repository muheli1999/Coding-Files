Hello, and welcome to the Dinosaur Game. 

This game is derived from the Google Chrome dinosaur game, which appears on the browser when it fails to connect to the 
Internet. I have attempted the IOS development of such game using Xcode and Swift language, with help from multiple Youtube
videos. Although those videos do not demonstrate the coding of the dinosaur game per se, they have introduced me to the Swift
language while working on their own games. 

The final objectives of the game include:
1. A start menu containing tabs such as "New Game" and "Scoreboard," as well as request to enter the player's name. 
2. A game scene that is almost identical to the Google Chrome game, with elements of the dinosaur, several types of cactus, 
and birds. (Possibly with additional elements). HI score should be recorded as well as current score.
3. A pause menu that stops the game and enables the player to return to the main menu. 
4. A "game over" scene that appears when the dinosaur comes into contact with any object. 
5. A scoreboard that allows users to access scores achieved by all players on their device. 

(Pending supplementation)
Below is the update log:

As of Aug 2, 2019:
Project now runs on IOS simulator on Mac. Requires IOS 12.0. Background initialized, dinosaur is able to jump upward upon 
touching anywhere on the screen. Game can generate and delete cacti separated by randomized time intervals. 

Next steps: Improve background. Adjust positions of dinosaur and cacti. Need refined images of these elements. Set up collision
