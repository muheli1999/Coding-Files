Note:
This log is the property of Yijie Chen (GitHub ID: COEN24) who has recorded the progress of our joint work. I started working
on the project on July 1, 2019 and he joined our team on July 15, 2019. Below is his update log from his own GitHub repository,
which I translated from Chinese to English.

I was responsible for the 7.19 and 7.30 updates. 
===============================================================================================================================

2019.7.17
Current objective:
1. We currently have the accuracy, error analysis, and plotting of LSTM and ARMA. 
2. Finish the coding of the other 2-3 models.
3. Study the correlation between sites.
4. Set different time lags (delays) and number of neurons for the LSTM model and compare errors.
5. Choose the best time lag and number of neurons and analyze the types of data that yield the best results. 
6. Compare results and compose paper.

2019.7.19
Improved ARMA, although the code does not run on "accumulation of dirt" data file. All other data files have been run and 
graphed. Still requires further work.

Finished ARMA in the afternoon.

To summarize the results: "illegal littering" is the most accurately predicted one, "accumulation of dirt" does not run, no 
further information on the correlation between data types and accuracies. Hoping that stablizing data will shed light on the
issue. Will attempt ARIMA to improve data stability.

===============================================================================================================================

2019.7.22
Finished SVR, but the results are unsatisfactory. Differentiation and stablization of data succeded. As of ARMA and ARIMA, we 
can exculde data stability as the reason for the failure. Possibly caused by the inaccurate ordering of (p,q). Will further 
investigate.

Auto-Arima can automatically change p and q, but only produces a trend. 

Sample data does not have particular trend or seasonality, therefore we conclude that LSTM is the best model in our case.

Will attemp different ordering methods, then work on LSTM.

===============================================================================================================================

2019.7.30
Modified LSTM, which is now compatible with all data files. Currently studying algorithm and Keras. Will discuss prediction by
site with senior researchers. Will also conduct tests on LSTM changing variables such as rate of study and number of layers. 
Will try to draw conclusions on their correlation with accuracy. 

===============================================================================================================================
(below are my own updates)

2019.8.1
Deleted irrelevant codes in LSTM(edited). Fixed output file problems. Provided useful comments in Chinese. Will attempt 
translation to English once project is finished. Also added "references" folder which contains several papers on which this
project is based. I will write a similar one modeled on the English paper towards the end of the project. 

Note that the output files are unavailable here as it contains government information. However, the code should run on any file
with the required properties described in the REAMDME file under "Machine Learning Project." A sample data file will be 
providedfor reference. 

As of right now, the necessity of developing a site-by-site LSTM model is under discussion. Yijie Chen is studying the 
correlation between sites while I am awaiting further directions from Tong Wu, a graduate student of Chinese Academy of 
Sciences.

2019 8.8
We have decided to use LSTM by site. Yijie came up with the code, but it required that I run it for each site with different 
parameters, totaling hundreds of times of manual operations. I modified the code so that a loop took care of everything, 
including saving files to their assigned locations. It took my computer an entire night to run the whole loop. 

With my code, any file can be run using any parameters with a single click. I believe this will facilitate our testing by a
significant amount of time.
