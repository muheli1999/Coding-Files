In this folder, all coding files using the LSTM and ARMA models are uploaded and constantly modified. In addition, we have 
recently added Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods. 
*******************************************************************************************************************************
Python libraries required for SVR:  
future, time,pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib

Python libraries required for ARIMA:
pandas, numpy, scipy,tushare, datetime, statsmodels, matplotlib, sklearn, math, pmdarima

Running results:  
LSTM model can function on all available data files. ARMA works on all but one, in which case the data stability did not statisfy
 minimum requirements using the order determined by the ARMA funciton. SVR functions on all files. ARIMA is not yet ready for 
testing and will likely be abandonned in the future. Please note that the main objective is the LSTM model. 

LSTM has the least error after 100 epoches of iteration, however maximum accuracy is usually achieved at around 40 epoches. ARMA
error is greater than LSTM but smaller than SVR. 

In terms of the types of data that are accurately predicted, it can be concluded that stable and close-to-linear data sets yield 
the most satisfactory results, regardless of method.

Please refer to "figures" folder for graphic results.
